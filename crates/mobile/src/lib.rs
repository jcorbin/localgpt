//! LocalGPT Mobile — UniFFI bindings for iOS and Android
//!
//! This crate provides a minimal FFI surface for mobile apps to interact
//! with LocalGPT's core functionality. Phase 2 of the mobile RFC.
//!
//! For now this is a placeholder — UniFFI integration will be added
//! once the core crate extraction (Phase 1) is validated.
